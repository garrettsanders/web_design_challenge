                    This visual shows the correlation between the humidity of a city in comparison to their latitude. My hypothesis before seeing this
                     graph was that there would be much higher levels of humidity the closer the city is the equator (latitude zero). My prediction was
                      proven to be incorrect however, as there were high level of humidity around latitude zero, but also high levels concentrated when 
                      the city latitude was larger.
