                    This visual shows the correlation between wind speeds of cities in comparison to their latitudes. A few takeaways from 
                    this graph is that there are quite a few high wind speed outliers to factor in the findings. Most frequently wind speeds
                     lie between 0 to 5mph across all city latitudes. There is not any major correlations occurring between wind in cities and 
                     their latitudes.
